            <h3>Collection of General Information When Visiting Our Website</h3>
            <h4>Type and Purpose of Processing</h4>
            <p>
            When you access our website, i.e. if you do not register or otherwise
            transmit information, information of a general nature is automatically
            collected. This information (server log files) includes, for example, the
            type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your
            Internet service provider, your IP address, and similar data.
            </p>
            <p>The data is processed in particular for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Ensuring a smooth connection to the website</li>
            <li>Ensuring smooth use of the website</li>
            <li>
                Ensuring and evaluating system security and stability, especially for
                abuse detection
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensuring a technically error-free presentation and optimization of the
                website
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            We do not use this data to draw conclusions about your identity. However,
            we reserve the right to subsequently review the server log files if there
            are concrete indications of unlawful use.
            </p>

            <h4>Legal Basis and Legitimate Interest</h4>
            <p>
            Processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR based on
            our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of
            our website as well as ensuring system security and detecting misuse.
            </p>

            <h4>Recipients</h4>
            <p>
            Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as
            processors for the operation and maintenance of our website.
            </p>

            <h4>Storage Duration</h4>
            <p>
            Data is stored in server log files in a form that allows identification of
            the data subjects for a maximum of 90 days, unless a security-relevant
            incident occurs (e.g. a DDoS attack).
            </p>
            <p>
            In the event of such an incident, server log files are stored until the
            security-relevant incident has been fully resolved and clarified.
            </p>

            <h4>Provision Required or Necessary</h4>
            <p>
            The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor
            contractually required. However, without the IP address, the service and
            functionality of our website cannot be guaranteed. In addition, individual
            services may not be available or may be restricted.
            </p>

            form will be transmitted to us and stored.

            Contact is also possible via the provided email addresses. In this case,
            the personal data transmitted with the email will be stored. This includes
            the date and time the email was sent, email address, IP addresses, and
            information about the servers involved in the email communication.
            </p>

            <p>
            Regardless of the chosen method of communication, we collect the content
            of your inquiry. Your data will be stored for the purpose of individual
            communication with you.
            </p>

            <h4>Legal Basis</h4>
            <p>
            Data processing is carried out on the basis of a legitimate interest (Art.
            6(1)(f) GDPR).
            </p>
            <p>
            Our legitimate interest in processing your data is to enable uncomplicated
            contact with us.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you contact us to request an offer, the data processing is carried out
            to perform pre-contractual measures (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR).
            </p>

            <h4>Recipients</h4>
            <p>
            Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as
            processors for the operation and maintenance of our website.
            </p>

            <h4>Storage Duration</h4>
            <p>
            Data is deleted no later than 90 days after the inquiry has been
            processed.
            </p>
            <p>
            If a contractual relationship arises, we are subject to statutory
            retention periods. These generally amount to 6 or 10 years for reasons of
            proper accounting and tax law requirements.
            </p>

            <h4>Provision Required or Necessary</h4>
            <p>
            The provision of your personal data is voluntary. However, we can only
            process your inquiry if you provide us with the required data and the
            reason for your inquiry.
            </p>

            <h4>Right to Object</h4>
            <p>
            Please refer to the information on your right to object under Art. 21 GDPR

            <h3>Right to Object on a Case-by-Case Basis</h3>
            <p>
            You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your
            particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you
            which is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (processing based on a balancing of
            interests); this also applies to profiling based on this provision within
            the meaning of Art. 4(4) GDPR.
            </p>

            <p>
            If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can
            demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which
            override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the establishment,
            exercise, or defense of legal claims.
